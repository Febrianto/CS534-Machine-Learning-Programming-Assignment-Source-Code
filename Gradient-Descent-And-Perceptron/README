README

The README file is used to illustrate how to use the source code for the programming assignment 1 of machine learning course. This project is done by myself. I wrtie the code and report. 

In order to use the source code to get the desired result, you should follow the following step.

	(1) First step and the most important step

	>> load assignment1.mat
	The command is used to load the four datasets in this experimentation

	(2) Linear Regerssion 
	
	>> [theta_vec_batch, theta_batch, sseerr_batch, theta_vec_stochastic, theta_stochastic, sseerr_stochastic, sseconvergence_batch, sseconvergence_stochastic] = regression( regression_training, regression_testing);
	The command is used to create all datas for the experimentation

	(3) Perceptron

	>> twogaussianmiserror = batchperceptronfortwogaussian(twogaussian);
	The command is used to get the misclassification error and plot the final decision boundary

	>> irismiserror = votedperceptronforiris(iris);
	The command is used to get the misclassification error and plot the final decision boundary

	>> irismiserrormodified = votedperceptronforirismodified(iris);
	The command is used to get the w_avg  and plot the final decision boundary
