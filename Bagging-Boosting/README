The README file is used to illustrate how to use the source code for the programming assignment 3 of machine learning course. This project is done by myself. I also wrtie the code and report independently.

In order to execute the problem, just follow the steps below 

1. Go to matlab environment
2. load SPECT.mat
3. ensemble_demo(train, test);

This will train SPECT dataset using two ensemble algorithms, respectively Bagging and Adaboost.

If you have any problem about the program and the report, please contact with me(xie@eecs.oregonstate.edu). Thanks very much.
