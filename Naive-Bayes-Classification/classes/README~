The README file is used to illustrate how to use the source code for the programming assignment 2 of machine learning course. This project is done by myself. I also wrtie the code and report independently.

In order to execute the problem, just follow the step below 

$ java -cp classes NaiveBayes
(Just for Note: the execution may take several minutes.)

This will train Newsgroup dataset using two Naive Bayes Model: respectively Bernoulli case and Multinomial case and output their performance.

If you have any problem about the program and the report, please contact with me(xie@eecs.oregonstate.edu). Thanks very much.
